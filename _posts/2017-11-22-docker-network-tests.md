title: Docker Network Tests under Host/Bridge Mode

Recently we are considering to dockernize our computation slots and integrate them
into a Kubernetes like container management system. There are two network models
in docker, `Host` vs `Bridge`, and we have some debates on which one to adopt. This
post introduces some performance testing result to support our decision.

If you don't know about docker network types, please see [this docker document](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/). I am testing
network performance with following scenarios.

1. Docker container with `Bridge` mode
2. Docker container with `Host` mode
3. Physical machines without docker container

To measure the network performance, I am leveraging a Linux tool [qperf](https://linux.die.net/man/1/qperf).
The tests are really simple, in each scenario, use qperf to measure the network
bandwidth and latency between two `hosts`, where the a host can be a docker container
or a physical machine.


```Shell
# install qperf
yum install qperf.x86_64

# On one host, start qperf server
qperf

# On the other host, run
qperf <host/ip>Â tcp_bw tcp_lat conf
```

Each case, I've run qperf for 5 times and counted an average value, see following result,

| Env | bandwidth(Bridge) | bandwidth(Host) | bandwidth(Physical) | latency(Bridge)  | latency(Host) |latency(Physical) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Same physical machine | 4024 | 4639 | 4874 | 9.04 | 7.9 | 6.73 |
| Two different physical machines | 1010 | 1013 | 1035 | 20 | 17.5 | 17.1 |

Summary:

1. If containers are running on same physical machine, network bandwidth under `Host` mode is
**15%** bigger than `Bridge` mode, but **5%** slower than just physical machine. Regarding of latency,
it is **14%** faster than `Bridge` mode but **17%** slower than physical machine.
2. If containers are running on two different physical machine, network bandwidth under `Host` mode is
**0.3%** bigger than `Bridge` mode, but **2.2%** slower than just physical machine. Regarding of latency,
it is **14%** faster than `Bridge` mode but **2.3%** slower than physical machine.

Simply speaking, if running on same physical machine, `Host` mode is a lot better than `Bridge`;
however, if running on two different machines, `Host` mode is only slightly better, the performance
can both achieve nearly to what physical machine's limit.
