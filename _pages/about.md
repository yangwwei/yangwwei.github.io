I start my career from IBM, and spent 6 excellent years on building a Hadoop based
data platform, known as BigInsights or later IOP. In 2017, I joined [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/)
as a Senior Software engineer. Now I am focusing on evolving the Realtime Computation Platform to serve world-largest
e-commerce online & offline workloads. I am very passionate in
Open Source area and have lots of experiences, an active [apache Hadoop committer](http://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?uid=wwei). I hold a master degree of [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/).
