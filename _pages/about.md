### ABOUT ME

@[Hortonworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hortonworks). Continue to evolve YARN for better enterprise adaption. Containerize, performance, service, ML and more ...

@[Alibaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group). I was excited working on Apache Hadoop YARN at `10k+` nodes scale. Focus area: resource over-subscription, multi-dimension resource support, global scheduling, placement constraint/node attributes.

@[IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM). I had multiple roles, a startup member of `BigInsights` project (A Hadoop based BigData Platform Offering by IBM), a `backend engineer` (cluster installation/monitoring), a `team lead`, a `BigData architect` (worked with 50+ customers), a mentor, and more over an `open source contributor` (Apache Hadoop HDFS & YARN, 50k+ LoC, until 2018).
