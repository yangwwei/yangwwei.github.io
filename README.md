This is my personal blog built with **Friday Theme** on Github pages.
Friday Theme is a Bootstrap 4 portfolio and blog theme for Jekyll, I've tried many other themes and end up with using this one because it is relativly easy, less depenedencies and very neat/clean layout.

See the theme author's homepage: http://www.freytag.org.uk
