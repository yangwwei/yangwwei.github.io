I joined IBM in 2011 when I just graduated from Peking University. I started
my internship 1.5 year earlier in the same team, that's when I began to work on
Hadoop. Our team was created to incubate a "startup" project called `BigInsights`,
(later known as `IOP`), an apache Hadoop based BigData platform. We started from
scratch, in the first few years, I was focusing on creating a cluster provisioning
and monitoring system, written by Java and Shell code. I started to lead the installation
backend team since 3rd quarter of 2011. I took the full ownership of this component,
and lead a 3~4 people team for production development. I worked with some
front-end folks in Canada and some other component owners in U.S closely on end-to-end
integration. At that time, I engaged more than 50 customers and handles lots of
urgent issues during which earned a lot of experiences.

From 2015, I moved on and switched my role to open source Hadoop team lead. I lead
up a 3 people team to work on the IBM distribution of Hadoop, co-own this component
with U.S peer team. My object was to ensure IBM distro of Hadoop fully satisfies
customer's requirements. I fixed a lot of bugs and made a lot improvements, and I
was also very active contributing these to apache community. In 2 years time, I've
contributed more than 100 patches to HDFS, YARN and Hadoop common.

Since 1 quarter of 2017, I started work on `Ozone` project. This project is leading
by some Hadoop PMCs from Hortonworks. It is quite famous because of its ambition of
fixing long-standing HDFS scalability and small-file problems. At Sep 2017, I was
recognized to become to be an `Apache Hadoop Committer`.
