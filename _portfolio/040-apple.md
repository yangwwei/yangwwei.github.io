1. Oct 2024 – Present: Leading the development of `Apple Batch`, a managed service for batch compute powering data processing
and ML workloads. The service features cross-cloud and cross-region support, along with heterogeneous resource discovery and
management. Designed a truly serverless architecture for batch workloads in a modern, cloud-native way.

2. Aug 2023 – Oct 2024: Built Apple’s first internal `Batch Inference Service`, supporting large-scale workloads for 150+ teams.
Designed and deployed on AWS EKS with a multi-cluster GPU infrastructure. Led API server design, implemented priority scheduling
and preemption using Apache YuniKorn for GPU resource management.  Achieved an average GPU utilization of 80%+.

3. Apr 2022 to Aug 2023:Scaled Apache Spark on Kubernetes at Apple, enabling large-scale batch processing across EKS and GKE.
Worked on [Batch Processing Gateway](https://github.com/apple/batch-processing-gateway),
leveraging [Apache YuniKorn](https://yunikorn.apache.org/) for resource management and scheduling. Leveraging
[Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/) for autoscaling, instance lifecycle management, and Kubernetes version upgrades.
