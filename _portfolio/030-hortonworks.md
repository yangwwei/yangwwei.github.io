At Hortonworks, I am continuing to evolve Apache Hadoop YARN :)

1. The adaption of [Container Storage Interface](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec) in Apache Hadoop YARN. Umbrella JIRA: [YARN-8811](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-8811). Design doc: [pdf download](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12947187/Support%20Container%20Storage%20Interface%28CSI%29%20in%20YARN_design_doc_v3.pdf).
